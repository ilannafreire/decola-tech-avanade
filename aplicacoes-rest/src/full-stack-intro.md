## 🖥️ What is Web Development?

Web development refers to the process of creating websites and applications for the internet or an intranet. It encompasses a variety of tasks, including web design, web programming, database management, and server engineering.

### 🧩 Key Components
- **Front-end**: The part of the website that users interact with directly. It involves creating user interfaces and experiences using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Back-end**: The "behind-the-scenes" part of a website, where data processing, database management, and server control occur. It involves languages like Python, Java, Go, etc.

## 🌍 How the Web Works

The internet is a global network of interconnected computers. The Web, or World Wide Web, is an information system built on top of the internet that uses the HTTP protocol to transmit data.

### 🔑 Key Concepts
- **Internet vs. Web**: The internet is the infrastructure, while the Web is a service built on top of it.
- **HTTP Protocol**: The fundamental protocol used for data transfer on the Web. When a user accesses a website, the browser sends an HTTP request to the site's server, which responds with the site's data.
- **DNS Resolution**: The URL is translated into an IP address using the Domain Name System (DNS).
- **Server Response**: The server processes the HTTP request and sends back the site's files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- **Browser Rendering**: The browser interprets these files and displays the site to the user.

## 🎨 Front-end and Back-end Technologies

### 🖌️ Front-end: The User Interface
Front-end development focuses on the user interface. The goal is to present information in an interactive and accessible way for the end user.

#### 🛠️ Key Technologies
- **HTML**: Structures the content of the web.
- **CSS**: Styles and presents the HTML content.
- **JavaScript**: Makes web pages interactive and dynamic.

### ⚙️ Back-end: The Logic Behind the Scenes
Back-end development involves the server, application, and database. It is responsible for managing and processing data, ensuring that everything on the front-end works correctly.

#### 🛠️ Key Technologies
- **Languages**: Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, JavaScript, etc.
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle, etc.
- **Frameworks**: Django (Python), Express (JavaScript), Spring Boot (Java).

### 🚀 Full Stack Development
Full Stack developers are professionals skilled in both front-end and back-end development, capable of working in both areas.

## 🔗 APIs - Fundamental Concepts

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and definitions that allows different software applications or components to communicate with each other. It acts as an intermediary, enabling requests and responses between different systems.

### 💡 Value of APIs
APIs are crucial for building modern and scalable applications. They allow flexibility to integrate and expand functionalities without reinventing the wheel.

### 📂 Examples of APIs
- **Payment APIs**: Facilitate e-commerce transactions across different payment platforms.
  - Example: [Vindi API Documentation](https://vindi.github.io/api-docs/dist/#/)

## 📦 Types of APIs

### 🔄 RESTful APIs
RESTful APIs follow the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer). They are based on HTTP standards and are used for web interactions.

#### 📝 Characteristics
- Use of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations.
- Easy to understand and implement.

### 📜 SOAP APIs
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol that defines a standard for exchanging XML-based messages.

#### 📝 Characteristics
- XML-based protocol for information exchange.
- Platform and language-independent.
- Supports complex operations and advanced security.

### 🎯 GraphQL APIs
GraphQL is a query language for APIs, allowing clients to specify exactly what data they want.

#### 📝 Characteristics
- Efficient in reducing requests and data size.
- Flexible and strongly typed, facilitating API evolution.

### 🤔 Choosing the Right API
The choice depends on the project's specific needs, available resources, and team expertise. RESTful is popular for simplicity, SOAP is preferred for security and complex transactions, and GraphQL is ideal for dynamic and personalized data applications.

## 📡 HTTP Verbs

In RESTful APIs, HTTP verbs have specific roles that align with CRUD operations. This standardized approach makes APIs intuitive and predictable, facilitating interaction between different systems and applications.

### 📋 RESTful Conventions
- **GET**: Read data.
- **POST**: Create data.
- **PUT/PATCH**: Update data.
- **DELETE**: Remove data.
